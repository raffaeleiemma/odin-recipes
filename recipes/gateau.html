    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To prepare potato gateau, start by boiling the potatoes. To do this,
        rinse the spuds and place them into a large saucepan, covering with
        plenty of cold water
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the pot over heat and, as soon as the water starts to boil, count
        about 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes. Test them
        with a fork
      </li>
      <li>
        to make sure that they are actually cooked: if the fork easily reaches
        the center of the largest potato, they are ready. Drain the potatoes and
        start peeling them while they are still hot, helping yourself with a
        small knife to avoid scalding your hands
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, mash them immediately in a bowl: when they are hot, the
        potatoes are easier to mash and will virtually be lump-free
      </li>
      <li>In the meantime, dice the mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>and place it in a sieve to drain any excess liquid</li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you can squeeze it with a clean cloth. Dice the
        Neapolitan salami into about 1/3 inch (1 cm) pieces
      </li>
      <li>and do the same with the slice of ham</li>
      <li>Now take the freshly mashed potatoes and add the eggs</li>
      <li>a sprinkling of pepper</li>
      <li>salt, a drizzle of oil</li>
      <li>and grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>
        on top of the eggplant that are draining to create another layer with
        the newly fried eggplant
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, move on to the assembly: Start by adding some of the tomato
        sauce to a 9x13-inch (20x30-cm) baking dish
      </li>
      <li>
        Form the first layer by arranging the fried eggplant slices in the dish
      </li>
      <li>then spooning over more sauce</li>
      <li>spreading it evenly, and sprinkling in cubes of fiordilatte</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>and some basil leaves</li>
      <li>Start a new layer by adding more tomato sauce</li>
      <li>
        and fried eggplant slices, which should be arranged facing opposite
        directions. Then add more cheese and basil leaves
      </li>
      <li>Repeat these steps until you reach the last layer of eggplant</li>
      <li>
        again adding sauce and the fiordilatte that you set aside, torn into
        pieces by hand
      </li>
      <li>Finish off with grated Parmigiano cheese</li>
      <li>
        and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for around 30
        minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        When the eggplant parmigiana is finished baking, let it rest for 15-20
        minutes before serving
      </li>
    </ol>
