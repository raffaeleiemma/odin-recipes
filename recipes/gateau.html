      <li>Mozzarella Fior di latte: 10.58 oz (300 gr)</li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>Eggs: 4</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>Pepper as needed</li>
      <li>Milk: 3.38 fl oz (100 ml) (half glass)</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the potatoes and mash them with a fork or with a potato masher; if
        the potato is too dry, add a glass of warm milk, otherwise two
        tablespoons of olive oil to facilitate processing anyway.
      </li>
      <li>
        Separately beat the eggs, adding salt, pepper, Parmesan and pecorino;
        add the mixture to the potatoes and mix vigorously.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a high and round (or also rectangular) baking pan, add oil, then
        lay a layer of the mixture and cover with slices of salami and strips of
        Fiordilatte mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form another layer in the same way, close with the potato mixture, cover
        with breadcrumbs and a drizzle of oil.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in a hot oven for 30 - 40 minutes at 180Â°. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
