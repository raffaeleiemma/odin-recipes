    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The queen of single-course meals, the lifter of spirits:
      <strong> eggplant parmigiana. </strong> It’s a recipe shared by regions in
      both the north and south of Italy
    </p>
    <p>
      The name <em>Parmigiana</em> is said to come from the Sicilian
      <em>Parmiciana</em>, which in dialect refers to the blinds made up of
      wooden slats stacked on one another.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eggplants</li>
      <li>Tomato puree</li>
      <li>Fior di latte mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese</li>
      <li>Yellow onions</li>
      <li>Basil</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>
      <li>Fine salt</li>
      <li>Peanut seed oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add enough olive oil to a pot to cover the bottom and heat</li>
      <li>
        Then add the onion to the pot. Let it brown for a couple of minutes,
        stirring often so it doesn't burn, then add the tomato purée
      </li>
      <li>Season with salt and add the basil leaves</li>
      <li>
        Add a little water to the container the tomato purée was in to rinse it,
        pouring the water into the pot. Let this cook for 45-50 minutes over low
        heat
      </li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, cut the fiordilatte cheese into small cubes, setting
        aside one piece that you’ll use at the end
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the cheese cubes to drain in a colander positioned in a bowl
      </li>
      <li>
        then cover with plastic wrap and set aside: This will allow the excess
        liquid to drain off
      </li>
      <li>Now, turn to the eggplant: Wash and trim them</li>
      <li>Cut them lengthwise into slices around 1/4 inch (4-5 mm) thick</li>
      <li>
        Once sliced, fry the eggplant in peanut oil that’s been heated to 340°F
        (170°C), immersing a few slices at a time
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as they’ve turned slightly golden, drain on a tray lined with
        paper towel
      </li>
      <li>If you run out of space on the tray, place more paper towel</li>
      <li>
        on top of the eggplant that are draining to create another layer with
        the newly fried eggplant
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, move on to the assembly: Start by adding some of the tomato
        sauce to a 9x13-inch (20x30-cm) baking dish
      </li>
      <li>
        Form the first layer by arranging the fried eggplant slices in the dish
      </li>
      <li>then spooning over more sauce</li>
      <li>spreading it evenly, and sprinkling in cubes of fiordilatte</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>and some basil leaves</li>
      <li>Start a new layer by adding more tomato sauce</li>
      <li>
        and fried eggplant slices, which should be arranged facing opposite
        directions. Then add more cheese and basil leaves
      </li>
      <li>Repeat these steps until you reach the last layer of eggplant</li>
      <li>
        again adding sauce and the fiordilatte that you set aside, torn into
        pieces by hand
      </li>
      <li>Finish off with grated Parmigiano cheese</li>
      <li>
        and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for around 30
        minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        When the eggplant parmigiana is finished baking, let it rest for 15-20
        minutes before serving
      </li>
    </ol>
